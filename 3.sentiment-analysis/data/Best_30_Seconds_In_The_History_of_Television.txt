Would you speak to the people who believe it is a worthwhile vaccine and it is saving lives? Are they just dead wrong? Have they been fed a line from the federal government? Tim, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the people that went ahead and got the Jab. I speak their language. I would speak to them thusly. They understand that well. So all these millions of people that got the shots, they're just stupid? Yes.
